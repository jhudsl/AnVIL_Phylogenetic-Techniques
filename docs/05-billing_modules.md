## Create Google Billing Account


1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) console using your Google ID. **Make sure to use the same Google account ID you use to log into Terra.**  

1. If you are a first time user, don’t forget to claim your free credits! If you haven't been to the console before, once you accept the Terms of Service you will be greeted with an invitation to "Try for Free."

1. Follow the instructions to sign up for a Billing Account and get your credits. 

1. Choose “Individual Account”. This “billing account” is just for managing billing, so you don’t need to be able to add your lab members. You will need to give either a credit card or bank account for security. Don't worry! **You won't be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing**.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1tGpzZaQxoTAcxs_nyyNL2FOqypjEofEnMVpBtZiAw4A_g116ca06e27d_0_146.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Billing Account Setup, with &quot;Individual Account&quot; highlighted.  Also highlighted is text stating &quot;You won't be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid account.&quot;" alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Billing Account Setup, with &quot;Individual Account&quot; highlighted.  Also highlighted is text stating &quot;You won't be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid account.&quot;" width="480" />

1. You can view and edit your new Billing Account, by selecting “Billing” from the left-hand menu, or going direction to the billing console [console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) 

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1tGpzZaQxoTAcxs_nyyNL2FOqypjEofEnMVpBtZiAw4A_g116ca06e27d_0_293.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console dropdown menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console dropdown menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." width="480" />

1. Clicking on the Billing Account name will allow you to manage the account, including accessing reports, setting alerts, and managing payments and billing.  We will cover account management in greater detail below.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1tGpzZaQxoTAcxs_nyyNL2FOqypjEofEnMVpBtZiAw4A_g116ca06e27d_0_437.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console Billing Page, with the name of the new billing account highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console Billing Page, with the name of the new billing account highlighted." width="480" />

At any point, you can create additional Billing Accounts using the **Create Account** button.  We recommend creating a new Billing Account for each funding source.

## Add Terra to Google Billing Account


This gives Terra permission to create projects and send charges to the Google Billing Account, and must be done by an administrator of the Google Billing Account.

Terra needs to be added as a "Billing Account User":

1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) console using your Google ID.
1. Navigate to [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1OqSVH5Y4v97-OKMnEDGGuhKBJwc9fyXc-Q1-ivbeZmA_g115e284bdc2_0_144.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console drop-down menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console drop-down menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." width="480" />

1. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account.  If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking "Manage Billing Accounts" from the drop-down menu.

1. Enter a unique name for your Terra Billing Project and select the appropriate Google Billing Account. The name of the Terra Billing Project must:
    + Only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens
    + Start with a lowercase letter
    + Not end with a hyphen
    + Be between 6 and 30 characters
    + Be unique across all Google Billing Projects

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1POwxqv4p6AfPHJlN9VNq0TaT44fA2RAFSpIERIMHdWU_g116f8d759be_0_293.png" title="Screenshot of the Terra Add Billing Project dialog box." alt="Screenshot of the Terra Add Billing Project dialog box." width="480" />

The page doesn't always update as soon as the billing project is created.  If it's been a couple of minutes and you don't see a change, try refreshing the page.

## View Spend for Google Billing


You can always check your current spend through the Google Billing console, but remember

- There is a reporting delay (~1 day), so you cannot immediately see what an analysis cost
- Costs are reported at the level of Billing Projects, so if you have not created separate Billing Projects, you will not be able to determine where charges are coming from.

The Google Billing console displays information by Billing Account.  To view spending:
  
1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects.

1. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1Ofs1As7XZWmxnaBOZvNYzAiuuaYgn1ce700eHyCNg2Y_g115e284bdc2_0_144.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console drop-down menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console drop-down menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." width="480" />

1. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking "Manage Billing Accounts" from the drop-down menu.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1Ofs1As7XZWmxnaBOZvNYzAiuuaYgn1ce700eHyCNg2Y_g115e284bdc2_0_295.png" title="Screenshot of an individual Google Cloud Billing Account with the drop-down menu item &quot;Manage Billing Accounts&quot; highlighted." alt="Screenshot of an individual Google Cloud Billing Account with the drop-down menu item &quot;Manage Billing Accounts&quot; highlighted." width="480" />

1. Click on the name of the Billing Account for the project you want to view.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1Ofs1As7XZWmxnaBOZvNYzAiuuaYgn1ce700eHyCNg2Y_g115e284bdc2_0_150.png" title="Screenshot of Google Cloud Billing Accounts Overview. A Billing Account name is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud Billing Accounts Overview. A Billing Account name is highlighted." width="480" />

1. Look at the top of the **Overview** tab to see your month-to-date spending.
    
    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1Ofs1As7XZWmxnaBOZvNYzAiuuaYgn1ce700eHyCNg2Y_g1149729109c_0_0.png" title="Screenshot of a Google Cloud Billing Account Overview." alt="Screenshot of a Google Cloud Billing Account Overview." width="480" />
